you must disable vorp_cenima in order to use this script. they both wont run together

you need to have the job cinema to play the movie

you can use 2 commands: 

/startshow (show) (screen)

/scheduleshow (show) (screen) (server time hour) (server time minute) (server time date)

scheduling a show saves it in a js file and plays it when the server time in hour/minute and day occurs 
for example /scheduleshow  FARMERS_DAUGHTER BLACKWATER 23 25 7
will play the show FARMERS_DAUGHTER on the screen BLACKWATER at hour 23 minute 25 on the 7th of the month.
